# Dotfiles & Configs Arch Linux

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of building a desktop environment starting with a fresh Arch based installation. I will assume that you are comfortable with Linux based operating systems and command line interfaces. Because you are reading this, I will also assume that you've looked through some "tiling window manager" videos on Youtube, because that's where the rabbit hole starts. You can pick any window managers you want, but I'm going to use Qtile as a first tiling window manager because that's what I started with. This is basically a description of how I made my desktop environment from scratch.

## Arch Installation

The starting point of this guide is a right after a complete clean Arch based distro installation.

## Basic Qtile configuration

Now that you're in Qtile, you should know some of the default keybindings.

## Audio

```bash
sudo pacman -S pulseaudio

# Install
sudo pacman -S pavucontrol
```

## Brightness

Add config in #pending

```bash
sudo pacman -S brightnessctl
```
